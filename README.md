## Concept
This project shows some basic usage of Express.js features, including:
- handling incoming HTTP requests using express routes
- exploring the purpose of middleware and how it works 
- debugging express apps using [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- handling data included in HTTP POST requests
- handling file uploads using [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
- making requests from express to external APIs with [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and serving the data to the client
- setting environmental variables using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- use of a `.gitignore` file to exclude 3rd-party code and autogenerated files from version control tracking
- use of a `package.json` with npm to track dependencies and streamline installation.

Many of the features of Express exhibited in this project are explained at a high level in this [prepared lecture presentation](https://nyu-computer-science.github.io/software-engineering/express/).

## Intentional exclusions
There are some common practices that we have not included here, since we believe they are distraction's from a beginner's ability to master React's code patterns.
- inclusion of any front-end code
- inclusion of user account registration or log in functionality
- inclusion of unit testing modules, like mocha and chaai
- use of express-router

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` configuration file.
This is necessary before running the app, since the 3rd-party dependency code is excluded from version control by the `.gitignore` git settings file.

### `nodemon server`

Start up the web server application using `nodemon`, which will stop and restart the app anytime there is a code change.
